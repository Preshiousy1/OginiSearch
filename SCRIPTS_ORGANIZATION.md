# Scripts Organization Summary

## Overview

Successfully organized and cleaned up the Ogini Search Engine scripts directory for proper environment-specific usage with Docker and npm integration.

## Changes Made

### 🗂️ Directory Structure Reorganization

**Before:**
```
scripts/
├── debug-server.sh (duplicate)
├── start-server-optimized.sh (duplicate)
├── ultra-conservative-debug.sh (testing data)
├── test-memory-leak-fixes.js (linting issues)
├── cleanup-heap-snapshots.sh
├── run-performance-tests.sh
├── verify-coverage.sh
└── generate-performance-report.js
```

**After:**
```
scripts/
├── development/
│   └── start-debug.sh           # Development environment
├── production/
│   └── start-optimized.sh       # Production environment
├── testing/
│   ├── run-memory-tests.sh      # Memory testing suite
│   ├── memory-leak-test.mjs     # Clean memory leak tests
│   └── test-components.js       # Component testing
├── cleanup-heap-snapshots.sh   # Maintenance
├── run-performance-tests.sh     # Performance testing
├── verify-coverage.sh           # Coverage validation
├── generate-performance-report.js # Performance reporting
└── README.md                    # Documentation
```

### 🧹 Cleanup Actions

1. **Removed Duplicate Scripts:**
   - `start-server.sh` (root directory)
   - `scripts/debug-server.sh`
   - `scripts/start-server-optimized.sh`
   - `scripts/ultra-conservative-debug.sh`

2. **Fixed Problematic Files:**
   - Replaced `scripts/test-memory-leak-fixes.js` (linting issues) with clean `scripts/testing/memory-leak-test.mjs`
   - Moved `test-components.js` to `scripts/testing/`
   - Removed duplicate `scripts/generate-performance-report.mjs`

3. **Cleaned Testing Data:**
   - Reduced memory test iterations from 5000 to 500
   - Lowered memory thresholds from 100MB to 30MB
   - Removed excessive test data and made tests production-appropriate

### 📦 NPM Script Integration

Added environment-specific npm scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:memory": "./scripts/testing/run-memory-tests.sh",
    "dev:start": "./scripts/development/start-debug.sh",
    "prod:start": "./scripts/production/start-optimized.sh",
    "coverage:verify": "./scripts/verify-coverage.sh",
    "cleanup:heap": "./scripts/cleanup-heap-snapshots.sh"
  }
}
```

### 🐳 Docker Integration

**Development (docker-compose.yml):**
- Uses `npm run dev:start` → `scripts/development/start-debug.sh`
- 2GB heap, debug logging, trace GC

**Production (Dockerfile):**
- Uses `./scripts/production/start-optimized.sh` as CMD
- 4GB heap, minimal logging, optimized settings
- Copies only necessary production scripts

### ⚙️ Environment-Specific Settings

| Setting | Development | Production | Testing |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Max Heap | 2048MB | 4096MB | 1024MB |
| Cache Size | 5,000 | 10,000 | 1,000 |
| Eviction Threshold | 70% | 80% | 50% |
| GC Interval | 30s | 60s | 10s |
| Memory Monitoring | 15s | 30s | 5s |
| Logging Level | Debug | Info | Debug |
| Batch Size | 50 | 100 | 10 |

## Usage Examples

### Development
```bash
# Start development server with debug settings
npm run dev:start

# Run memory tests
npm run test:memory

# Clean up profiling files
npm run cleanup:heap
```

### Production
```bash
# Start production server with optimizations
npm run prod:start

# Verify test coverage
npm run coverage:verify

# Docker production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive memory tests
npm run test:memory

# Run standalone memory leak tests
node --expose-gc scripts/testing/memory-leak-test.mjs

# Run component isolation tests
node scripts/testing/test-components.js
```

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Environment Separation
- Clear separation between dev, prod, and test configurations
- No more confusion about which script to use when
- Environment-appropriate resource allocation

### ✅ Docker Optimization
- Production containers use optimized startup scripts
- Development containers use debug-friendly settings
- Proper script copying and permissions in Dockerfile

### ✅ Memory Management
- All scripts include memory optimization settings
- Environment-specific memory limits and monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of profiling artifacts

### ✅ Maintainability
- Organized directory structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- NPM script integration for easy usage

### ✅ Testing Reliability
- Clean memory leak tests without linting issues
- Production-appropriate test data sizes
- Comprehensive test coverage validation

## Automation Ready

### Cron Jobs
```bash
# Daily cleanup
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/ConnectSearch && npm run cleanup:heap

# Weekly memory validation
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/ConnectSearch && npm run test:memory
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
npm run test:memory
npm run coverage:verify
npm run cleanup:heap
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance:** Use the organized scripts to monitor memory usage across environments
2. **Automate Cleanup:** Set up cron jobs for regular maintenance
3. **Extend Testing:** Add more environment-specific tests as needed
4. **Documentation:** Keep the scripts README.md updated with any new additions

The scripts are now properly organized, environment-specific, and ready for production use with Docker and npm integration.
